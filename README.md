# My first JavaScript project

At IT-HÃ¶gskolan I developed a recipe website built with JavaScript and an API. Users can search among a wide variety of recipes using a simple search function. The results are presented in an easy-to-understand format with all relevant information, including ingredients and instructions. Feel free to try it out and provide feedback.
